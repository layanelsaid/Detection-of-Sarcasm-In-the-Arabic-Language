# Detection-of-Sarcasm-In-the-Arabic-Language
My Bachelor code which is detecting Sarcasm for the Arabic Language
A crucial component of any language is sarcasm. It comprises indirect, im- plicit expressions of thoughts, views, emotions, and feelings.arcasm is a challenge for Sentiment Analysis tasks that primarily rely on surface meanings and properties due to its hidden aspect in a sentence. This work implemented different detection and classifi- cation models to detect sarcasm for the Arabic Language. ArSarcasm and ArSarcasm-v2 datasets were merged to improve the performance of all models. Many deep learning mod- els have been developed using the AraBERT word embedding, including RNN-BiLSTM, GRU-BiLSTM, BiGRU-BiLSTM, and BiLSTM-BiLSTM. 
Various changes were made to tune the hyper-parameters, including the optimizer, epochs, batch size, and activation functions. Changing the word embedding from FastText to AraBERT increased the per- formance of the models regarding the evaluation metrics. The model with the highest accuracy and F-score was the RNN-BiLSTM. The model achieved an F-score of 93.1% and an accuracy of 97.5%. For the rest of the models, BiLSTM-BiLSTM, GRU-BiLSTM, and BiGRU-BiLSTM achieved an accuracy of 97.3%, 97.4%, and 97.2%, respectively, and an F-score of 92.7%, 92.6%, and 92.1% respectively.
